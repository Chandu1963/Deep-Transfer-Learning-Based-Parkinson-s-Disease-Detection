6. Building the model 

Flask Framework
----------------
 
7. Flask Framework with Sqlite for signup and signin
8. Importing the packages
9. User Upload an image for analysis
10. The given input is preprocessed 
11. The trained model is used for predicting the result
12. Final Outcome is display 

  

Extension
----------
In the base paper, the author mentioned to use different models for analysis the Parkinson Disease, with different Deep Learning model and from which proposed ResNet50 + VGG19 + InceptionV3 model Feature extracted model with KNN got 95% accuracy 
As an extension we applied an ensemble method  combining the predictions of multiple individual models to produce a more robust and accurate final prediction. 
However, we can further enhance the performance by exploring other ensemble techniques such as Voting Classifier in Xception based FE and Voting Classifier in Proposed model based FE  on  models, from which Xception got 100% of accuracy,
As an extension we can build the front end using the flask framework for user testing and with user authentication.
